Hello, this is a project me and a friend are working on to hone our unreal skills and create a portfolio project showcasing our ability to put together a project as a team.
We have a full concept laid out and have made plans to work on the project in acheivable milestones on an as available basis until we can eventually consider the project complete or presentable.
Ideally we create a game that is not just a good showcase of our abilities, but that we can also market, though that is a very far off event even should it be possible.
We hope that through this project we can improve our abilites and get some experience owrking on a live project with other people, having to learn how to communicate and 
collaborate in order to achieve an end goal and maintain a fun game, while also being able to retain themes, flow, progression, and again, most importantly, fun as the project
is collaborated on by multiple minds and put through many iterations and testing.
Working title is space scavenger but we will focus on making a good name once we are closer to real release, working title sufficing for now.
We hope to learn a lot and maybe get something fun out of it in the end. Thank you, we hope you enjoy!

(Unreal build folders are too big to host through github, so we host it through drive for now.)
